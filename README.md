##Problem 1

What could have gone wrong is that while one servant unlinked the predecessor to add a new gift to the chain, but had not yet finished linking it to the next in the chain, another servant came and removed that present at the same time. This causes us to completely lose the part of the chain that came after that present. If this happens even once, at the end the servants will end up having counted more presents than written thank you notes.

Yes, we can help the minotaur by using a concurrent linked list chain implementation with thread-safe guarantees via locking or other methods.
